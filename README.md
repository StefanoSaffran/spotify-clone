## :information_source: How to run the application locally
### Requirements
To run the app, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.13.1 or higher and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

The Application was develop using Expo. It is a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to facilitate the process of running and testing applications. [Click here](https://expo.io/learn) to get start with Expo.

Now clone the repository and install the dependencies.
```bash
# to clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StefanoSaffran/spotify-clone.git

# go into the project folder
cd spotify-clone

#install the dependencies
yarn

```

In order to run the application on your device, you need to change the ip config in 2 places.

1. [package.json](https://github.com/StefanoSaffran/spotify-clone/blob/master/package.json)
```json
  "server": "json-server --host 192.168.0.185 -p3333 db.json -w"
```
2. [api.js](https://github.com/StefanoSaffran/spotify-clone/blob/master/src/services/api.js)
```javascript
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.0.185:3333',
```
replace 192.168.0.185 with your machine's ip.

Now with everything on place, run the json-server that has the application data and then run the app.
```bash
# to run the json-server
yarn server

# to run the app
yarn start
```
Expo will open a page in your browser, scan the QRcode on the page and wait for the app to load.

> The Application was developed and tested on Iphone 6s
